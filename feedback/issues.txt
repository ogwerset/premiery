ISSUES TO FIX:
==============

Issue #1:
---------
Description: map doesn't work at all - it should be zooming in on the diagram and showing a translucent blue rectangle on the current user position 
Screenshot: screenshots/map off.png
Priority: [ x] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low
Location: probably app.js
Notes: we could just keep it under the small button and make it available only per user clicking, not by default 


Issue #2:
---------
Description: the outline is off, needs complete switch off. I also don't like how the buttons are popping out, reconsider this animation. 
Screenshot: screenshots/outline.png, screenshots/weird bounce.png
Priority: [ x] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low
Location: probably app.js too
Notes: very important, this bug causes this app to be really unpleasant to use 


Issue #3:
---------
Description: the dark mode glitch - there's always a place with white bg on the map - probably it has something to do with my export from draw io - i went over the limits of the resolution. needs a way to be resolved

Priority: [ ] High  [ x] Medium  [ ] Low

Notes:

Issue #4
---------
Description: mobile fixes - the menu should be a hamburger menu type icon unrolling from the upper right corner, the title should fit in place, the button logic needs to be double checked and the best possible mobile version should be produced. 
the dev mode notification could be closeable too.
